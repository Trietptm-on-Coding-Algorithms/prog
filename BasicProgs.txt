Basic Programs

This Document will list simple basic programs that will help someone learn the syntax and style of a language. Each program will be able to be ran seperate from any other program.

Algorithms



001User Interaction
	Hello World - Print to command line
	Repeater - reads phrase from user. Repeats phrase in all caps.
	ArgPass - read arguments from command line. Use loop
	Calculator - Create a GUI with a library to create a simple calculator
002Variables Functions and Scope
	BeerOnTheWall - loop, function, pass strings and integers
	WheresTheBass - test importing functions outside of the file
	UseTheVars - Demonstrate functionalities
	(datatype)Play - experiment with a data type. Use built in features.
003Data Structures
	Arrays
	(create an additional file for each built in data structure)
004Files
	Success100 - write success 100 times.
	Failure57 - using a file created with Success100, change the 57th success to failure
	Random CSV - make a csv file with a random ID, and random columns
	ReadCSV - read the csv file and perform calculations
005Networking/Web
	HTMLGrab - pull html from a URL
	Pinger - measure time between
	ChatServer
006OOP Paradigm
	AnimalObject - String name, number weight, method noise
	Inherits -
	Interface - 
007Functional Paradigm
	FirstClass - demonstrate a first class function
008Logical Paradigm
	Predicate
009Other Paradigms
	(use what the language has to offer)
010Threads
	RecursiveFactorialDouble - create a program that calculates factorial seperately on two threads.
011Databases
	Table maker - use Random CSV program to add in data to make a  table full of random table
	OpsCall - execute the each letter of CRUD
012Graphics
	Circle - draw a circle
	WaterMarks - put a water mark on an image
013Sound
	Beep - cause a beep
014Video
	Ripple - draws ripples emanating from center
015Features
	(Experiment with a feature of a language to learn how to use it.)
