Basic Programs

This Document will list simple basic programs that will help someone learn the syntax and style of a language. Each program will be able to be ran seperate from any other program.

Data Structures(not in core language)
Algorithms



001User Interaction
	Hello World - Print to command line
	Repeater - reads phrase from user. Repeats phrase in all caps.
	ArgPass - read arguments from command line. Use loop
	Calculator - Create a GUI with a library to create a simple calculator
002Variables Functions and Scope
	(Body of basic language is used here)
	(Error Handling)
	BeerOnTheWall - loop, one function, strings, ints
	WheresTheBass - test importing functions outside of the file
	(datatype)Play - experiment with a data type
	Find pi to the Nth digit - find limits of accuracy
	Collatz Conjecture - Use recursion and 
		start with a number n > 1 find steps it takes to reach 1
		if n%2==0 divide by 2
		otherwise n*3+1
003Data Structures
	Arrays
	(create an additional file for each built in data structure)
004Files
	Success100 - write success 100 times.
	Failure57 - using a file created with Success100, change the 57th success to failure
	Random CSV - make a csv file with a random ID, and random columns
	ReadCSV - read the csv file and perform calculations
005Networking/Web
	Chat Client
	FTP Program
	Port Scanner
	Page Scraper
006OOP Paradigm
007Functional Paradigm
008Logical Paradigm
009Other Paradigms
010Threads
011Databases
	Table maker - use Random CSV program to add in data to makea  table
012Graphics
	Water Marking
013Sound
014Video
015Features
	(Experiment with a feature of a language to learn how to use it.)
